Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Streamlit:

This project demonstrates a deep learning model for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM model is designed to capture and leverage the sequential patterns in historical stock data to forecast future prices. The frontend is built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive interface for users to input stock ticker symbols, view historical data, and visualize predicted trends.

Features
LSTM Model: A neural network tailored for time series prediction, particularly suited for stock price forecasting.
Streamlit Interface: A user-friendly web application for real-time interaction, allowing users to explore the model's predictions visually.
Data Visualization: Display of historical and predicted stock prices with dynamic charts.
Custom Inputs: Users can select different stocks and adjust model parameters through the Streamlit interface.

Usage:
Install required dependencies from requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app with streamlit run app.py.
Input a stock ticker and see the prediction results.
