Medicinal Plant Recognition using CNN with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS Frontend:

This project focuses on recognizing medicinal plants through images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The goal is to accurately classify different medicinal plants based on their visual characteristics, aiding in plant identification and research. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of plant images, and the frontend is built using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS for a clean, responsive user interface.

Features:

CNN Model: A deep learning model designed to classify medicinal plants with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: The frontend is developed with HTML, styled with Bootstrap and CSS, offering an intuitive platform for users to upload images and view results.
Responsive Design: The web application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
Image Upload & Prediction: Users can upload plant images, and the model will predict the plant species and display the results instantly.

Usage:
Install the necessary dependencies.
Run the backend server to serve the CNN model.
Open the HTML file in your browser to use the application.
Upload an image of a medicinal plant and view the prediction results.
